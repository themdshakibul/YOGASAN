                    Yoga is a holistic practice that unites the body, mind, and spirit through physical postures,
                    breathing techniques, and meditation. It promotes flexibility, strength, and balance while reducing
                    stress and fostering mental clarity. Practicing yoga regularly can also improve posture, boost
                    energy levels, and enhance overall well-being. Whether you're looking to relax, build strength, or
                    find inner peace, yoga has something to offer everyone.

                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Absolutely not! Yoga is designed for everyone, regardless of your current level of flexibility. In
                    fact, many people start yoga to become more flexible over time. Yoga meets you where you are,
                    allowing you to progress at your own pace. Remember, it’s not about touching your toes on day
                    one—it’s about the journey to feeling more comfortable and confident in your body.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Wear clothing that is comfortable, breathable, and stretchy to allow a full range of motion. Yoga
                    pants or leggings paired with a fitted top work well, ensuring your clothing stays in place during
                    poses. Yoga is practiced barefoot, so no special footwear is needed. If you tend to sweat, consider
                    bringing a small towel and dressing in moisture-wicking fabrics.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    For those new to yoga, styles like Hatha, Vinyasa, or Gentle Yoga are excellent starting points.
                    Hatha focuses on foundational poses and breathing techniques, while Vinyasa offers a more fluid
                    sequence of movements. Both styles are beginner-friendly and provide a great introduction to yoga's
                    benefits. Many studios also offer dedicated beginner classes or workshops.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Starting with 2-3 sessions per week is ideal for beginners. This schedule allows your body to adapt
                    while building consistency. As you become more comfortable, you can increase your frequency. Even a
                    10-15 minute daily practice can make a big difference in your physical and mental well-being.

                        All you need to start is a yoga mat for comfort and stability. Other optional props include
                        blocks, straps, and bolsters, which help with alignment and make poses more accessible. Most
                        studios provide these props, but you can also purchase them for home practice. If you're unsure,
                        reach out to your instructor—they'll guide you on what's necessary.

                    promotes mindfulness, which helps you make healthier choices and manage stress-related eating.
                    Remember, the combination of movement, breathwork, and mindful living is key to long-term wellness.

                    While yoga often incorporates meditation, the two practices focus on different aspects of
                    well-being.<br>
                    •&nbsp;<strong>Yoga</strong> includes physical movement, breathing exercises, and mindfulness to
                    enhance overall health.<br>
                    •&nbsp;<strong>Meditation</strong>, on the other hand, is the practice of focusing the mind, often
                    in stillness, to achieve mental clarity and relaxation.<br>
                    Combining yoga and meditation can help you achieve balance, reduce stress, and cultivate a deeper
                    connection with yourself.

                    Most yoga classes range from 60 to 90 minutes, which includes warm-up, the main practice, and
                    relaxation (Savasana). However, shorter classes, such as 30-minute sessions, are available for busy
                    schedules. For beginners, these shorter sessions can be a great way to ease into the practice.

                    Yes, absolutely! Many online platforms, apps, and videos offer guided yoga sessions for all skill
                    levels. Home practice allows flexibility in your schedule and environment. To get started, find a
                    quiet, comfortable space and use a yoga mat or soft surface. Consider joining live virtual classes
                    for real-time guidance and support.
